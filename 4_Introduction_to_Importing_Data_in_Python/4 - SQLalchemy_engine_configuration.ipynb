    "### Engine Configuration\n",
    "The Engine is the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application. It’s “home base” for the actual database and its DBAPI, delivered to the SQLAlchemy application through a connection pool and a Dialect, which describes how to talk to a specific kind of database/DBAPI combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure can be illustrated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where above, an Engine references both a Dialect and a Pool, which together interpret the DBAPI’s module functions as well as the behavior of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an engine is just a matter of issuing a single call, create_engine():\n",
    "\n",
    "The above engine creates a Dialect object tailored towards PostgreSQL, as well as a Pool object which will establish a DBAPI connection at localhost:5432 when a connection request is first received. Note that the Engine and its underlying Pool do not establish the first actual DBAPI connection until the Engine.connect() or Engine.begin() methods are called. Either of these methods may also be invoked by other SQLAlchemy Engine dependent objects such as the ORM Session object when they first require database connectivity. In this way, Engine and Pool can be said to have a lazy initialization behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Engine, once created, can either be used directly to interact with the database, or can be passed to a Session object to work with the ORM. This section covers the details of configuring an Engine. The next section, Working with Engines and Connections, will detail the usage API of the Engine and similar, typically for non-ORM applications."

    "The create_engine() function produces an Engine object based on a URL. The format of the URL generally follows RFC-1738, with some exceptions, including that underscores, not dashes or periods, are accepted within the “scheme” portion. URLs typically include username, password, hostname, database name fields, as well as optional keyword arguments for additional configuration. In some cases a file path is accepted, and in others a “data source name” replaces the “host” and “database” portions. The typical form of a database URL is:\n",
